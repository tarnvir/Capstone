# Capstone
This will be the repo to hold all code

# General Notes
PLEASE do not commit directly to the main brach. The coding strategy will be as follows
##
**Main:** This holds production code. AKA code that is tested and works. Does not matter if it is missing some features.
##
**Developer:** This is the branch you will forck and push **Working Changes to.** Make sure that you are making small changes in you branches testing them and then making a pull request into Developer to avoid non working code
##
**Branches:** Make as many seperate branches as needed but if you make a pull request to merge into a different branch make sure that your branch works before hand!!!!!
